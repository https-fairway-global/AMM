Got it. I’ll investigate how modular inverse operations can be implemented within Compact language circuits (on Midnight) specifically for `Field` and `Uint` types, focusing on their use inside zero-knowledge circuits to enable division-like behavior.

I’ll look into:
- Whether Compact supports modular inverses natively for `Field` or `Uint`
- How to safely implement them on-chain within current compiler constraints
- Known workarounds or best practices from examples or Midnight documentation

I’ll get back to you shortly with concrete guidance and code-level examples if available.

# Implementing Modular Inverse in Midnight’s Compact Language

## Field vs. Uint Arithmetic in Compact  
Midnight’s **Compact** smart contract language provides two numeric types: **`Field`** and **`Uint`**. A `Field` represents an element of the proving system’s prime field (i.e. arithmetic is *modular*), whereas `Uint<0..N>` represents a bounded unsigned integer between 0 and N (inclusive) ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=match%20at%20L344%20,is%20the%20TypeScript)). In other words, **`Field` arithmetic automatically wraps around modulus** (overflow wraps to 0) ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=,the%20unsigned%20subtraction%20is%20performed)), while **`Uint` arithmetic is “safe”** (no overflow – the result type is widened if needed, and subtraction triggers a runtime error if the result would be negative) ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=,the%20unsigned%20subtraction%20is%20performed)). Crucially, Compact **does not have a built-in division operator** – only addition, subtraction, and multiplication are defined for numeric types ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=Binary%20arithmetic%20expressions%20are%20of,and%20multiply)). This means there is **no native “`/`” or modular inverse** operation available by default in the language. If you need division-like behavior (i.e. multiplying by an inverse), you must implement it manually within the circuit logic.

## No Native Division Operator (Modular Inverse Needed)  
Because Compact lacks a division operator ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=Binary%20arithmetic%20expressions%20are%20of,and%20multiply)), performing a “division” requires computing a **multiplicative inverse** and then multiplying. For a **`Field`** value (which lies in a prime field), any non-zero element has a modular inverse (the number which, when multiplied, yields 1 mod *p*). However, **Compact does not provide a direct function to get a Field’s inverse**, so you must use a workaround. The typical approach is to leverage a **witness function** – an external TypeScript/JavaScript function – to compute the inverse off-chain, and then use it in the circuit. 

**Why a witness?** In a zero-knowledge circuit, computing an inverse via an algorithm (e.g. Extended Euclidean algorithm or exponentiation by *p–2*) would be complex and could lead to large intermediate values that violate bounds or are expensive to constrain. Instead, you can calculate the inverse in normal code and supply it to the circuit as a witness value. Compact allows calling such witness functions, and will include the returned value as part of the proof witness ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=Calls%20are%20evaluated%20by%20evaluating,returned%20by%20the%20witness%20function)) (making the circuit “impure”, which is acceptable for this use-case). The circuit can then *verify* the inverse is correct with a simple multiplication check.

## Modular Inverse for `Field` Types (Safe On-Chain Division)  
To implement a safe division-like operation on a `Field` in Compact, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure the divisor is non-zero:** You should enforce that the value you want to invert (the divisor) is not 0. In a circuit, dividing by 0 has no valid inverse and will make the constraints unsatisfiable. You can use an assertion to guard against this (for example, `assert(divisor != 0, "Cannot divide by zero");`). In Midnight, assertions are used to enforce such conditions at runtime (see the docs’ pseudocode example using `assert(...)` to validate inputs ([Smart contracts on Midnight | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/how-midnight-works/smart-contracts#:~:text=def%20guess_number,new_b))). This will cause the transaction to fail with an error if someone ever tries an invalid divisor.

2. **Use a witness to compute the inverse:** Define a witness function in your Compact contract, e.g.:
   ```typescript
   // In Compact, declare a witness for computing modular inverse
   witness invField(x: Field): Field
   ```
   The actual implementation of `invField` is provided in TypeScript (off-chain). For example, in TypeScript you can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or binary exponentiation to compute `x^(-1) mod p`. The witness will take a `Field` value and return its inverse modulo the field’s prime. (The underlying field prime is fixed by the ZK proving system – e.g., Halo2’s base field – so you can compute mod `p` using BigInts.) **Important:** The witness should throw or handle the case `x = 0` if it occurs, to avoid returning an invalid result.

3. **Multiply and assert correctness in-circuit:** Call the witness in your circuit and use the result. For example: 
   ```typescript
   import CompactStandardLibrary;
   export circuit safeDivide(a: Field, b: Field): Field {
       assert(b != 0, "Cannot divide by zero");
       let invB = invField(b);            // call witness to get modular inverse of b
       // Constrain that invB is truly the inverse of b (b * invB should == 1 mod p)
       assert((b * invB) == (1 as Field)); 
       return a * invB;  // this is effectively a/b mod p
   }
   ```
   In the above circuit, `invB` is provided by the witness function (executed off-chain), and then we **verify** `b * invB ≡ 1 (mod p)` inside the circuit ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=Calls%20are%20evaluated%20by%20evaluating,returned%20by%20the%20witness%20function)). This constraint ensures the witness didn’t lie. Finally, `a * invB` yields the result of “a divided by b” in the field. All operations (`*` and the comparison) happen on Field elements and thus are mod *p* arithmetic ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=,the%20unsigned%20subtraction%20is%20performed)). The Compact type system knows `invB` and `b` are Fields, so the multiplication automatically wraps mod *p* ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=,the%20unsigned%20subtraction%20is%20performed)).

4. **Use constant inverses when possible:** If the divisor is a known constant, you can avoid even needing a witness – simply compute that constant’s inverse once (offline) and hard-code it. For example, dividing by a literal 5 could be done as `a * c` where `c` is the precomputed value of 5<sup>–1</sup> mod *p*. Since `c` is a compile-time constant, the multiplication is just a normal field multiplication in the circuit. This only works for known constants; for variable divisors, a witness approach as above is needed.

This method ensures “safe” division in the sense that you never actually perform an illegal operation in the circuit – you assert the divisor is valid, and you only multiply by an inverse that has been externally validated. The on-chain verification (the ZK proof) will fail if the inverse is incorrect or if the divisor was 0, protecting the logic.

**Midnight Documentation Guidance:** The Midnight docs imply that to get Field arithmetic semantics, you must use `Field`-typed values ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=The%20static%20typing%20rules%20imply,Field)). Ensuring one operand is a `Field` (as we do above) means the result is computed mod the field prime ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=,the%20unsigned%20subtraction%20is%20performed)). The docs also confirm that only addition, subtraction, and multiplication are built-in for numeric types ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=Binary%20arithmetic%20expressions%20are%20of,and%20multiply)) – division must be handled manually by such construction. Additionally, any values passed into or out of witnesses are checked against their type’s bounds at runtime ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=match%20at%20L344%20,is%20the%20TypeScript)). Because `Field` values are by definition modulo the field prime, any BigInt returned by `invField` will be reduced mod *p* (either by the witness itself or by the runtime), so it will satisfy the Field’s “maximum value” constraint ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=,index%20for%20the%20enum%20elements)). In summary, the recommended approach per Midnight’s model is to compute complex math like inverses off-chain and verify it with simple constraints on-chain.

## “Division” for `Uint` Types (Integer Division in Circuits)  
For **`Uint` types**, there is no direct concept of a modular inverse, since `Uint` arithmetic isn’t modulo a prime (and not every integer has a multiplicative inverse in an integer ring). If you need to perform a division or ratio on integers within a circuit (for example, computing a quotient and remainder), you must also use a custom construction or witness. Two common patterns are:

- **Treat Uints as Fields for division purposes:** If your use-case permits, you can *cast* the integers to `Field`, perform the Field division as above, and then (if needed) cast back or constrain the result to be an integer. This effectively does division mod the field prime, **not** standard integer division. This approach only makes sense if you know the division will have no fractional remainder and that all values are small relative to the field modulus (so that field division corresponds to the integer division). Otherwise, you could get a field element that doesn’t correspond to the expected integer quotient. Use this with caution – it’s usually better to explicitly handle quotient and remainder.

- **Compute quotient (and remainder) via witness:** To implement actual integer division (Euclidean division) in the circuit, the typical solution is to supply the **quotient** (and optionally remainder) as witnesses, then enforce the division relation with constraints. For example, suppose you have `a` and `b` as `Uint` values and want to compute `q = floor(a/b)` (assuming integer division). You can define a witness function that returns a tuple `[q, r]` where `q = ⌊a/b⌋` and `r = a mod b`. Then in your circuit:
  ```typescript
  witness divUint(a: Uint<0..A>, b: Uint<0..B>): [Uint<0..A>, Uint<0..B>]  // returns [q, r]
  export circuit divideUint(a: Uint<0..A>, b: Uint<0..B>): Uint<0..A> {
      assert(b != 0, "Cannot divide by zero");
      let [q, r] = divUint(a, b);
      // Constrain the division relationship: a = b * q + r
      assert(b * q + r == a);
      // Constrain remainder range: r < b
      assert(r < b);
      return q;
  }
  ```
  In this snippet, `divUint` (a witness) computes the integer quotient `q` and remainder `r`. The circuit then **checks** that `a = b*q + r` and that `0 ≤ r < b`. These two assertions guarantee that `q` and `r` represent a correct division result. The output of the circuit is `q` (the quotient). If you require an exact division (with no remainder allowed), you can add `assert(r == 0)` as well. This approach gives you true integer division semantics inside the ZK circuit.

**Handling Uint Ranges:** Note that we chose the types of `q` and `r` such that they won’t overflow or violate bounds. For example, we declared `q` as `Uint<0..A>` if `a` was `Uint<0..A>`, because the quotient can never exceed `a` in value. We declared `r` as `Uint<0..B>` (where `B` is the max of the divisor type) – this is safe because `r < b` and `b` itself is at most `B`, so `r < B+1`. We also explicitly assert `r < b`, which is a stronger condition; this helps the prover/verification catch any out-of-range remainder. Since `Uint` types have **runtime bounds checks** ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=match%20at%20L344%20,is%20the%20TypeScript)), if our witness returned a `q` or `r` outside the declared range, the proof would fail (a **MAX_BOUND error**). By designing the types and adding the `r < b` constraint, we ensure no such runtime errors occur. 

**Known Limitations – Range and Max Bound:** Compact will throw a *static type error* at compile time if you ever define a `Uint` type or expression whose bound exceeds the maximum allowed (which is essentially the maximum field value, since all Uints are ultimately represented in the field) ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=For%20arithmetic%20operations%20with%20,than%20the%20maximum%20unsigned%20integer)) ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=For%20arithmetic%20operations%20with%20,than%20the%20maximum%20unsigned%20integer)). This is likely what is meant by **“MAX_BOUND” errors**. For instance, if you tried to multiply two very large Uints such that the result’s bound is larger than the underlying field can represent, the compiler will complain that the result bound is greater than the “maximum unsigned integer” allowed ([Compact reference | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref#:~:text=For%20arithmetic%20operations%20with%20,than%20the%20maximum%20unsigned%20integer)). In practice, this means you may need to cast to `Field` (accepting modular semantics) for extremely large values or break down the computation. In the context of division, if `a` and `b` are within reasonable size (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit ranges), using a witness as above won’t hit this limit because `q <= a` and `a` itself is within bounds. Just be mindful to choose type bounds that can accommodate your largest expected results. 

Finally, the **Midnight community and documentation** emphasize using these patterns to handle division. For example, the Midnight team has demonstrated that to **“incorporate division”** in Compact, one can either rely on off-chain computation (witness functions supplying the inverse or quotient) or restructure the problem to avoid needing a direct division in-circuit (such as using algebraic identities or different coordinate representations in algorithms). Both approaches leverage the fact that the circuit only needs to **verify** the correctness of the result, rather than perform the full computation on-chain. By following this guidance – using witness-provided inverses/quotients and enforcing constraints like `b * invB = 1` or `a = b*q + r` – you can safely implement modular inverse operations for both `Field` and `Uint` types in Compact, without violating range limits or causing runtime errors. 

 The patterns described above align with Midnight’s recommended practices for safe arithmetic in ZK circuits, ensuring on-chain division-like behavior is achieved through sound circuit logic rather than unsafe operations.
